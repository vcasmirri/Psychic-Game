# Psychic-Game
This repository includes files for a simple, web-based letter-guessing game that utilizes JavaScript.

When the user presses a letter key on their keyboard, the code compares their "guess" to a randomly-chosen letter.
* If the guess is correct, the win counter increments up by one.
* If the guess is incorrect, the guess is displayed and the guess counter decreases by one.
* The user gets 9 guesses - once it reaches 0, the loss counter increments up by one.
* When the user wins or loses, the guess counter and guesses displayed are reset.
